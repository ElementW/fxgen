1) 	quality setting should be a selection control.
//2) 	all dialogs should have a 'delete point' operation.
//3) 	'add point' should pop up a dialog.
//4) 	it should be possible to enter a point position via edit controls.
//5)	on the graph, the x = 0 line dissappears when y=0 is offscreen ...
//6)	Terrace does not allow 'SetExtents()'.
//7)	Libnoise planes should be tileable.
//8)	need to extend libnoise to allow the plane to take 'depth'.
//9)	need to extend libnoise to create volume textures.
10)	need a volume texture dialog.			// next release
11)	need a terrain-viewer dialog.			// next release
//12)	crashes when trying to operate an L_ImageRenderer with 'cancel' on the dialog after it has been reassembled
13)	should not shutdown when trying to load a project with the wrong file format
14)	rename does not work for the projectWnd
//15)	extra code in dialogs (m_cstrName *and* m_lpszResName)
//16) 	terrace control should be square
17) 	should add 3d volume craters			// next release
//18)	need to tidy up variable names (done for GUI.h and GUI.cpp)
//19)	need to make an abstract 'graph' widget, and subclass the Terrace and Curve widgets
20)	Add a progress bar for libnoise 
//21)	make sure that the L_ImageRenderer is not using a light
//22)	--Derivative operator for calculating the heighfield slope
23)	halt execution in case of errors 
//24)	bug in 'select' module -- I think the problem is that I can't remove a source module
//25)	cannot press 'cancel' on gradient dialog sometimes
//26)	terrace control should have a button to add a smooth set of terrace points
//27)	graph object should not render text from corners
//28)	bigger gradient tool
//29)	rand button on gradient tool --> don't want a random gradient
//30)	terrace control points should not move below the terrace line y=x
//31)	points still have an annoying yellow box on them
32)	should add ticks to the graph widget
//33)	the program now crashes inexplicably now and then (closing the terrace dialog after a short time)
//34)	multi-select items don't work anymore.
35)	flow tool - source and sink etc for post processing
36)	the curve handles overlap and stick to each other a bit

//38)	Gradient in L_ImageRenderer used a hardcoded transform
//39)	Tidy up extra variables in Dialog.h
//40)	There is no Load operator in this current version - this is related to the popup menu issue
//41)	Added a Load-Var ability
42)	there is a bug on the L_Plane settings - project will crash if bad variables are used
