2</FONT></H1>
<P STYLE="background: transparent">This is the second tutorial in a
series that will show a user how to use ProTex to create textures
that incorporate libnoise. The readers should first acquaint
themselves with the <A HREF="http://tutorial1.html/">first tutorial.</A></P>
<P STYLE="background: transparent">This tutorial will take the user
through the new features within ProTex not previously available in
FxGen.

<DIV ID="Part1 - your first project" DIR="LTR" STYLE="background: #00ffff">
	<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.42cm; page-break-after: avoid"><FONT FACE="BankGothic Md BT, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Part
	1 &ndash; The Basic Types</FONT></FONT></P>
</DIV>
<P STYLE="background: transparent">Libnoise modules come in 6 basic
types. The types are listed below:-</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="background: transparent">Generators</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="background: transparent">Modifiers</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="background: transparent">Transformers</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="background: transparent">Combiners</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="background: transparent">Selectors</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="background: transparent">Misc</P>
</UL>
<P STYLE="background: transparent">In addition to these basic types,
Protex has incorporated the Noisemap builders introduced in the last
tutorial, and the L_ImageRenderer which was also introduced in the
last tutorial. All libnoise modules are prefixed by the letter 'L'
followed by an underscore. They are all colored green except for the
L_ImageRenderer that is colored red.</P>
<P STYLE="background: transparent">The version of libnoise included
with Protex has several new modules, including fBM, Hetero Terrain,
Multi-fractal, Hybrid Multi-fractal and a turbulence generator. These
can be found under the Generators menu in the Operators viewport.
These modules are documented in the book 'Texturing and Modelling: A
procedural approach&rdquo; and are available for download from the
<A HREF="http://cobweb.ecn.purdue.edu/~ebertd/book2e.html">website.</A></P>
<P STYLE="background: transparent">For a quick comparison of the new
modules, load up the project called 'fbm_compare.prj'. This project
contains the 2 pages containing arrays of the basic noise modules. On
the first page they are organised in terms of increasing octaves,
from left to right. On the second page the changing variable is
frequency. The modules require that the user creates an
L_ImageRenderer object and places it below the L_Plane objects, as
shown:-</P>

libnoise operators and their usage please refer to the <A HREF="http://libnoise.sourceforge.net/docs/modules.html">libnoise
documentation.</A></P>

	Combining modules and Saving the Output</FONT></FONT></P>
</DIV>
<P STYLE="background: transparent">Modules are combined in stacks in
the same way that FxGen modules are placed in stacks. FxGen operators
can be applied to the output of a libnoise module, however it is not
possible to apply libnoise modules to FxGen operators.</P>
<P STYLE="background: transparent">The projects are loaded and saved
through use of the file menu. The user should navigate to the 'Datas'
directory before loading a project. Projects should be postfixed with
the file extension *.PRJ, however this is not compulsory. 
</P>
<P STYLE="background: transparent">The Images menu allows the user to
save an image in the *.BMP format, and right-clicking in the Viewport
pane will give the user the option to save in *.TGA format.</P>
<P STYLE="background: transparent">The L_Cache object allows the user
to save the output of a set of libnoise modules. This allows the user
to load the same output multiple times. The load is achieved through
the use of the L_LoadCache object. Both the L_Cache object and the
L_LoadCache can both be found under the 'libnoise misc' menu. An
example of a save and load setup is shown below:-</P>
<P STYLE="background: transparent"><IMG SRC="../module21.JPG" NAME="graphics1" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=800 HEIGHT=600 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="background: transparent">The cache object is selected and
the name is changed to CACHE_1 as shown below:-</P>
<P STYLE="background: transparent"><IMG SRC="../module22.JPG" NAME="graphics2" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=800 HEIGHT=600 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="background: transparent">Next, the L_LoadCache objects are
selected and the pop-up menu in the Properties viewport is activated
by clicking the right mouse button. The pop-up menu has been
populated with the named variables of type L_Cache. Selecting one of
the variables (in this case the only variable is CACHE_1), will make
the name of the L_LoadCache object change its name.</P>
<P STYLE="background: transparent"><IMG SRC="../module23.JPG" NAME="graphics3" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=799 HEIGHT=604 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="background: transparent">And finally the L_ImageRenderer
object is double clicked to reveal the output:-</P>
<P STYLE="background: transparent"><IMG SRC="../module24.JPG" NAME="graphics4" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=800 HEIGHT=604 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="background: transparent">The cache objects are clearly very
powerful, and can also save a lot of processing time if used
correctly.</P>

	VAR Objects</FONT></FONT></P>
</DIV>
<P STYLE="background: transparent">One of the features new to
ProTex_0.5-alpha is the Var concept. The Vars can be found under the
Variables menu. The principle behind the vars is to store constant
numbers that will be reused in later modules. For example, if I
create a new perlin noise module and set the frequency to 2.73 and
the create another object that requires the same frequency, I find
that I am constantly rewriting the frequency. It is much easier to
store the value for freqency in a var, as shown below:-</P>
<P STYLE="background: transparent"><IMG SRC="../module26.jpg" NAME="graphics6" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=800 HEIGHT=600 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="background: transparent">The value in the 'Float Var'
object has been set to 2.73. The name is now set to 'frequency' as
shown:-</P>
<P STYLE="background: transparent"><IMG SRC="../module27.JPG" NAME="graphics7" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=800 HEIGHT=600 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="background: transparent">This variable named 'frequency'
can now be loaded up in ANY of the float properties, and a truncated
version can be loaded into the integer properties (I.e. 2.73 ~=2 and
3.333 ~= 3). This process is similar to referencing an L_Cache
object, however the menu will be populated with ALL the Var objects
in ALL pages and groups of the project.</P>
<P STYLE="background: transparent"><IMG SRC="../module28.JPG" NAME="graphics8" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=840 HEIGHT=600 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="background: transparent">After the frequency variable has
been added, the Frequency property item will display the value stored
in the 'frequency' Var, as shown:-</P>
<P STYLE="background: transparent"><IMG SRC="../module29.JPG" NAME="graphics9" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=800 HEIGHT=600 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="background: transparent">The way to change the frequency
variable is by editing the value in the 'frequency' variable and then
double clicking the 'frequency' block. All current numbers that
referenced the 'frequency' variable will be updated, however it is
not yet possible to save Var references. In the current version, up
to 256 numbers can be updated from a single Var object.</P>
<P STYLE="background: transparent">Vars have some associated
operators. These include:-</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="background: transparent">VARS SUM</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="background: transparent">VARS SUB</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="background: transparent">VARS MULTIPLY</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="background: transparent">VARS DIVIDE</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="background: transparent">VARS POWER</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="background: transparent">VARS LOG</P>
</UL>
<P STYLE="background: transparent">There is also an operator called
'Load Var' which can be used to reference another Var. This is
technically possible anyway, since the Vars themselves use a float
for a parameter, however it is not recommended to try to reference a
Var within a Var (in the current version &ndash; the abililty to do
that will be disabled in future releases). The project window below
shows some combinations of Var objects:-</P>
<P STYLE="background: transparent"><IMG SRC="../module30.JPG" NAME="graphics10" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=800 HEIGHT=600 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="background: transparent">This basically states:</P>
<P STYLE="background: transparent"> ( (frequency + Octaves) &ndash;
(some value)) / ( some value 2 )</P>
<P STYLE="background: transparent">The names of the 'VARS SUM', the
'VARS SUB' and the 'VARS DIVIDE' objects have been deliberately left
unchanged for purposes of illustration. In practical usage it is
necessary to name the objects, eg. VARS DIVIDE would be called
'Output_1' or something similar. 
</P>
<P STYLE="background: transparent">A major flaw in the way that Vars
work is that they ALL have to be double clicked before the operators
will process properly. The the output variable may have to be
selected twice after this process, but I assure you &ndash; It DOES
work!</P>

	<FONT FACE="BankGothic Md BT, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Part 4 &ndash;
	Dialogs</FONT></FONT></P>
</DIV>
<P STYLE="background: transparent">There are currently 3 types of
dialogs exclusive only to ProTex. These are The Gradient Dialog
(introduced in tutorial 1), the Curve dialog and the Terrace dialog.
In this section I will cover some of the controls of the dialogs.</P>
<P STYLE="background: transparent"><IMG SRC="../module5.JPG" NAME="graphics11" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=516 HEIGHT=415 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="background: transparent"> <B>The Gradient Dialog. </B>
</P>
<P STYLE="background: transparent">This dialog allows the user to add
and delete points, to set the color or position of an existing point
and to open and save an entire gradient. The end points cannot be
moved or deleted, since a gradient must have the minimum of 2 points.
The 'Add Point' and 'Set Position' buttons make a dialog appear that
allows the position of the gradient point to be set manually. It must
be a number between -1.0 and 1.0. The Set Color button makes a
typical Color picker appear, for the user to choose the color by
sight or to enter the color as text. The black rectangles below the
gradient rectangle are the representation of the gradient point.
These black rectangles can be selected with the left mouse button.
The selected rectangle will appear as a red box and is the subject of
the Delete Point, Set Color and Set Position buttons.</P>
<P STYLE="background: transparent"><IMG SRC="../module31.JPG" NAME="graphics12" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=516 HEIGHT=545 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="background: transparent"><B>The Curve Dialog.</B></P>
<P STYLE="background: transparent">This dialog allows the user to add
and delete points, to set graph extents and to Set the position of a
selected point. It is also possible to load and save a curve. All
curves are saved in the 'Curves' directory. Clicking the 'Add Point'
button will make a dialog appear with two text fields, one for the X
dimension and one for the Y dimension. The point will appear at the
position of the blue cross &ndash; the position where the user has
left clicked the graph &ndash; if the 'Ok' button on the 'Point
Confirm' dialog is pressed without any modifications to the variables
in the text boxes. The 'Point Confirm' dialog also appears if the
'Set Position' button is pressed. The application can handle as many
graph points as the user chooses, however the curve itself can only
manage up to 32 points. The 'Set extents' button allows the user to
view the graph from further out. The 'Set Extents' dialog is shown
below:-</P>
<P STYLE="background: transparent"><IMG SRC="../module32.JPG" NAME="graphics13" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=188 HEIGHT=221 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="background: transparent">Setting the X max value to 10
makes the graph shown above look as follows.</P>
<P STYLE="background: transparent"><IMG SRC="../module33.JPG" NAME="graphics14" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=516 HEIGHT=545 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="background: transparent">The graph tool is very powerful.
The red lines represent the Zero axes. Curves require a minimum of 4
points. The curve points can be inserted anywhere on the graph.</P>
<P STYLE="background: transparent"><IMG SRC="../module34.JPG" NAME="graphics15" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=516 HEIGHT=545 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="background: transparent"><B>The Terrace Dialog.</B></P>
<P STYLE="background: transparent">This dialog is basically the same
as the Curve dialog, apart from the 'Create Points' button and the
fact that the plot is a terrace plot with points having a Y value the
same as their X value. The Create Points button creates a smooth
distribution of points from the -1.0 point to the 1.0 point. When the
'Create Points' button is pressed a dialog appears requiring a value
for the number of points. The minimum number of points required for a
terrace control is 2 points. Unlike the curve tool, the terrace tool
does not allow the user to insert points behind the most recent
point. This means that points must be added to the end of the curve,
not at the beginning or inserted in the middle. If you want to add
points to the middle, please move the current points to the new
position and then add a point to the end.</P>
