A portable editor for FxGen, written in GTKMM.

Requirements:
to run: 
- gtkmm 2.8+
- thread-safe version of fxgen (rev. 96+)
to build: 
- gtkmm-devel 2.8+
- thread-safe version of fxgen (rev. 96+) - current version also requires 
THREADS_ENABLED to be defined
- boost (for lexical_cast, needed for testing; you may disable it in pch.h)
- Code::Blocks IDE

Current version (rev. 98), when compared to the original win32 editor, 
lacks the following functionalities:
- project browser is read-only and displays a flat list of pages
- clipboard usage leads to a segmentation fault
- editing properties of an operator may block the main menu - click 
everywhere to unlock it
- half of functions don't work when built on windows
- rubberband selection is not implemented (multiple selection already works)
- no preview zoom (but detail management works)
- no image export

Anyway, following features were added:
- smooth operation, no lock-ups
- better color control that can pick any color from the screen on linux; 
perhaps it will work on cygwin as well
