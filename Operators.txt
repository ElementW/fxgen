-------------------
Render Operators
-------------------

Name: Flat
Purpose: Create a flat texture of given color.
Details:
Inputs: no

Name: Cloud
Purpose:
Details: Clouds are constructed from 2 colors.
Inputs: no

Name: Gradient
Purpose:
Details: Each corner of the texture has unique color.
Inputs: no

Name: Cell
Purpose: Create a texture consisting of cells aligned in a grid.
Details: Cells can be irregular. If considered bump map, they have pyramid form.
Inputs: no

Name: Noise
Purpose:
Details: White noise of high quality. Texture can be filtered into a color.
Inputs: no

Name: Vector
Purpose:
Details: can render vector graphics. The Editor is also equipped with a
converter that can import SVG data to the vector operator.
Current version does not store vector data in projects.
Inputs: no

-------------------
Combine Operators
-------------------

Name: Nop
Purpose: No operation.
Details: Copies input to output.
Inputs: 1

Name: Rect
Purpose: Draw a rectangle on top of previous content.
Details:
Inputs: 1

Name: Pixels
Purpose: Draw a number of pixels at random positions.
Details:
Inputs: 1

Name: Add
Purpose: Combine inputs together.
Details: Provides several ways of combining. Clamps bitmap to first input size.
Modes:
Add Clamp
Add Wrap
Sub Clamp
Sub Wrap
Multiply
Multiply x2
Blend
Alpha
Layer - to adjust alpha, use one of operators: Colors or Alpha with second arg.
Inputs: arbitrary

Name: Glow
Purpose: Render a glow.
Details: Glow is a blurred, filled ellipse of given color, that is added to
existing content.
Inputs: 1

Name: Crack
Purpose: Create crack lines.
Details: Number, length and intensity of cracked lines can be set.
Inputs: 1

Name: Lerp
Purpose: Mix first two inputs (a, b) in proportions given by third input (c).
Details: Each color channel is processed separately. Equation: x = bc + a(1-c)
Inputs: 3

-------------------
Distord Operators
-------------------

Name: RotoZoom
Purpose: Rotate, scale and tile input.
Details: Can change bitmap size.
Inputs: 1

Name: Distort
Purpose: Apply normal (ie. vector) map to a bitmap.
Details:
Inputs: 2

Name: Vortex
Purpose: Twist some fragment of input bitmap.
Details:
Inputs: 1

Name: Lookup
Purpose: Copy pixels from first input (x,y), given coordinates from second input
(red,green).
Details: x = w * red, y = h * green
Inputs: 2

-------------------
Filter Operators
-------------------

Name: Blur
Purpose: Reduce sharpness ;)
Details: Two modes: Box and Gaussian.
Inputs: 1

Name: Colors
Purpose: Apply a color filter and color light, adjust contrast, brightness and alpha.
Details:
Inputs: 1

Name: Light
Purpose: Apply an illumination on a curved surface.
Details: First input is considered texture, second is normal map, third is per-pixel occlusion.
Ambient, diffuse and specular light can have different colors and intensity.
Inputs: 2-4(?)

Name: Normals
Purpose: Convert height map to normal map.
Details: 3-tap(?) Sobel.
Inputs: 1

Name: AlphaMask
Purpose: Extracts alpha channel as an opaque monochrome bitmap.
Details:
Inputs: 1

Name: Invert
Purpose: Invert all color channels. Alpha is left unchanged - use Colors filter
to adjust alpha.
Details: r:=1-r, g:=1-g, b:=1-b
Inputs: 1

Name: Threshold
Purpose: Change luminance curve around given value.
Details: Several ways.
Inputs: 1

Name: Alpha
Purpose: 1) Extract single color (light green #4C951D) intensity, replace it with
white smoke, discard the rest or 2) apply second input luminance as alpha channel,
or 3) apply second input as color alpha mask. Luminance is not taken into account.
Details:
Inputs: 1-2

Name: Segment
Purpose:
Details: takes segments input 1 based on a threshold, and colors each segment
based on input 2
Inputs: 2

Name: Dilate
Purpose:
Details: expands bright areas over darker areas
Inputs: 1
